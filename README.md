# Sticky Social Network (Frontend)
==================================

Sticky is a social network we developed to connect individuals within a centralized webapp.

This is the repository for our custom frontend UI, developed in conjunction with the Java application (link towards the bottom of this document).

Features
-------------------------------

 - Responsive and dynamic web pages
 - Ability to change user information, as well as uploading a profile picture
 - Create posts visible to all other users and upload images to them
 - User-friendly interface that is easy to navigate
 
Intructions To Run
-------------------------------

 1. Download files from repository.
 2. Run `npm install` to install all of the necessary dependencies.
 3. Change the various endpoints inside of the program to fit your backend API.
 4. From a command line in the current directory, do `npm run build` in order to build the project.
 5. From there, the application can be run on a Server (in our case, we utilized an AWS S3 bucket to host the website statically).
 
  Features We Would Like To Add
 ------------------------------
  - Additional styling to make certain UI features easier to digest.
  - Faster load times via reconfiguring of Availability Zone hosting.
